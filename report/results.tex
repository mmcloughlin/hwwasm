\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}

The previous section on implementation (\secref{intrinsics}) presented the
results of different techniques. The table below shows the end result compared
to alternative SHA-1 implementations and execution strategies.

Overall, these results demonstrate feasibility of the approach. Achieving
\MetricInlineWasmtimeHwwasmDivNative native execution qualifies for our ``near
native'' performance goal.

However, intrinsics fallback performance is disappointing, since it underperforms a
simple generic SHA-1 compiled to Wasm by a large margin.
%
The reason for this slowdown is likely the repeated \wasm function calls in
place of plain arithmetic/bitwise operations of the Plain C version. If
fallbacks performance was important, inlining would be a good approach to try.

In addition, the availability check functions proposed by
\citetitle{hw-spec-wasm} would allow redirection to a separate non-intrinsics
version if necessary.
%
Despite disappointing performance, fallbacks still successfully serve the goal
of preserving \wasm hardware-independence.
