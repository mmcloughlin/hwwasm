this presents the question of where the fallback functions would come from, and
how we could be assured of their correctness. Modern instruction sets are
expansive, so hand-written fallbacks would be tedious and error-prone to
produce. At the same time, vendors such as ARM now distribute machine-readable
specifications of their instruction set semantics, and recent research has
helped make them slightly more practical to use. This project will explore the
question of whether we can automatically derive fallback function definitions
from the instruction set specifications.
